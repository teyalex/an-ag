## This code was adapted by Alex Tey with the Center for Biological Diversity
  ## from code published by Faunalytics in collaboration with Sentient Media.

## View the original code and analysis here: https://osf.io/xmwgz/files/osfstorage

## Comments added in the Center's version are set off by double octothorpes (##)
  ## and a space, while comments from the original Faunalytics version are set off
  ## by a single octothorpe.
